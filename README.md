I've created a beautiful and functional digit recognition web app with the following features:  A responsive canvas where users can draw digits using mouse or touch input Real-time prediction using a pre-trained MNIST model loaded from TensorFlow.js Clean, modern UI with: Loading state while the model loads Clear canvas button Real-time prediction display Smooth drawing experience Touch support for mobile devices Error handling and loading states Beautiful glassmorphism effects using backdrop-blur The app uses a pre-trained MNIST model that's hosted online, so there's no need to train or convert a model. The model will be loaded when the app starts.
